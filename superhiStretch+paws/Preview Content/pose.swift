      description:
      "Did someone say dog? Can't we call this a downward-facing cat instead? It's OK – this is a friendly dog, it's not interested in chasing cats. In fact, Downward-Facing Dog is the lynchpin of a yoga asana practice: if you're going to befriend with any of these poses, make sure it's this canine classic.",
